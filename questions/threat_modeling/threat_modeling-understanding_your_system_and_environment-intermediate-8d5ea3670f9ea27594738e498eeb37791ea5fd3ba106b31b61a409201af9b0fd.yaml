question: What is the purpose of evaluating user roles and data classifications in
  threat modeling?
answers:
- a: To reduce the likelihood of successful attacks
- b: To identify and analyze potential risks that may arise due to system components
- c: To make informed decisions about risk management
- d: To understand and protect critical assets
correct_answer: d
explanations:
- a: Incorrect. Evaluating user roles and data classifications is important for protecting
    critical assets, but may not reduce the likelihood of successful attacks on its
    own.
- b: Incorrect. Analyzing potential risks due to system components is important, but
    user roles and data classifications are also vital components to consider.
- c: Incorrect. Making informed decisions about risk management may involve evaluating
    user roles and data classifications, but they serve a direct purpose in threat
    modeling beyond risk management.
- d: Correct. Evaluating user roles and data classifications is important to understand
    and protect critical assets, which is a primary goal of threat modeling.
