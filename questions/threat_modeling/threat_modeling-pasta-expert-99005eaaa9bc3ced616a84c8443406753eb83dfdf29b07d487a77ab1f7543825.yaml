question: In PASTA's Attack Library, what is the difference between an Attack Method
  and an Attack Vector?
answers:
- a1: An Attack Method describes the specific technique used in an Attack Vector
- a2: An Attack Vector describes the specific technique used in an Attack Method
- a3: Both terms refer to the same thing in the Attack Library
- a4: Neither term is used in the Attack Library
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. An Attack Vector is a path or means used by an attacker to gain unauthorized
    access to a system, while an Attack Method is a specific technique used to carry
    out an attack via an Attack Vector. For example, SQL Injection can be an Attack
    Method used via an Attack Vector of an input form.
- a2: Incorrect. See explanation for option A.
- a3: Incorrect. See explanation for option A.
- a4: Incorrect. The Attack Library is a core component of the PASTA methodology and
    contains a catalog of known attacks that can be used during the Threat Simulation
    step.
