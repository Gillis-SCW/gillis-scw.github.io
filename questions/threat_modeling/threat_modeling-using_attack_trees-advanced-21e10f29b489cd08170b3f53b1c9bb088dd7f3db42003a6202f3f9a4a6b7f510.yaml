topic: Threat Modeling
category: Using attack trees
level: advanced
question: What is a DFD and how is it used in conjunction with attack trees?
answers:
- a1: DFD is a data transfer diagram used to visualize attack paths in attack trees.
- a2: DFD is a diagram used to map system components and data flows for better analysis
    of threats.
- a3: DFD is a tool used to simulate attacks on a system modeled with attack trees.
- a4: DFD is a visualization tool used to map security controls and identify vulnerabilities
    in an attack tree.
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. DFD is not used to visualize attack paths.
- a2: Correct. DFD is a diagram used to map system components and data flows for better
    analysis of threats, usually in conjunction with attack trees.
- a3: Incorrect. DFD is not used to simulate attacks on a system modeled with attack
    trees.
- a4: Incorrect. While DFD is a visualization tool, it is not used to map security
    controls and identify vulnerabilities in an attack tree.
