topic: Threat Modeling
category: PASTA
level: advanced
question: What is the purpose of the PASTA Risk Mitigation step?
answers:
- a1: To eliminate all security risks identified during the Analysis phase
- a2: To reduce the likelihood or impact of security risks identified during the Analysis
    phase
- a3: To transfer the ownership of security risks to a third-party entity
- a4: To accept all security risks identified during the Analysis phase
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. It is not always possible to eliminate all security risks, even after
    the Analysis phase. Risk mitigation involves reducing the likelihood or impact
    of identified risks.
- a2: Correct. The purpose of the PASTA Risk Mitigation step is to reduce the likelihood
    or impact of security risks identified during the Analysis phase.
- a3: Incorrect. The PASTA methodology does not involve transferring the ownership
    of security risks to a third-party entity as a risk management strategy.
- a4: Incorrect. Risk acceptance is a valid risk management strategy, but it should
    not be the only approach taken after the Analysis phase.
