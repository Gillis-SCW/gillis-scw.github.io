question: What is the difference between static and dynamic attack trees?
answers:
- a1: Static attack trees are used for modeling physical systems, while dynamic attack
    trees are for modeling software systems.
- a2: Static attack trees do not incorporate countermeasures, while dynamic attack
    trees do.
- a3: Dynamic attack trees can be used for runtime analysis, while static attack trees
    cannot.
- a4: Static attack trees do not show the order of steps in an attack scenario, while
    dynamic attack trees do.
correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. The type of system being modeled does not determine whether a tree
    is static or dynamic.
- a2: Incorrect. Static attack trees can incorporate countermeasures, though they
    do not show their effect on the attack scenario.
- a3: Correct. Dynamic attack trees can be used for runtime analysis, allowing for
    real-time monitoring and updates to the model. Static attack trees do not have
    this capability.
- a4: Incorrect. Both static and dynamic attack trees can show the order of steps
    in an attack scenario.
