question: What is the difference between anonymization and pseudonymization of data?
answers:
- a1: Anonymization means that no one can identify an individual from the data, while
    pseudonymization means that personal identifiers are replaced with artificial
    identifiers to protect privacy.
- a2: Anonymization and pseudonymization are the same thing.
- a3: Anonymization means that personal identifiers are replaced with artificial identifiers
    to protect privacy, while pseudonymization means that no one can identify an individual
    from the data.
- a4: None of the above
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. Anonymization is the process of removing or destroying any identifying
    information that could link an individual to a dataset, so that the data is truly
    anonymized and cannot be linked to an individual. Pseudonymization, on the other
    hand, replaces personal identifiers with artificial identifiers to protect privacy,
    but the original data can still be linked to an individual if the artificial identifiers
    are re-identified.
- a2: Incorrect. This statement is completely false.
- a3: Incorrect. This statement confuses the concepts of anonymization and pseudonymization.
- a4: Incorrect. The correct answer is a) Anonymization means that no one can identify
    an individual from the data, while pseudonymization means that personal identifiers
    are replaced with artificial identifiers to protect privacy.
