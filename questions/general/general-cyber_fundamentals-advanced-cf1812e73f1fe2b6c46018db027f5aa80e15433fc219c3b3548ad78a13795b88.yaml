question: What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
answers:
- a: Symmetric encryption is faster but less secure than asymmetric encryption.
- b: Asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption, while
    symmetric encryption uses the same key for both.
- c: Symmetric encryption is used for data at rest, while asymmetric encryption is
    used for data in motion.
- d: Asymmetric encryption is common in enterprise environments, while symmetric encryption
    is more common in consumer applications.
correct_answer: b
explanations:
- a: Incorrect. Asymmetric encryption is typically slower but more secure than symmetric
    encryption, as it uses a more complex key management system.
- b: Correct. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data,
    while asymmetric encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key
    for decryption.
- c: Incorrect. Encryption algorithms can be used for both data at rest and data in
    motion, regardless of whether they are symmetric or asymmetric.
- d: Incorrect. Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption are used in a variety of
    contexts, from consumer messaging apps to enterprise data centers.
