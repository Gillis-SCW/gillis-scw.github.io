question: What is a zero-day exploit?
answers:
- a1: An attack that takes place on the zeroth day of the month.
- a2: A vulnerability in a system or software that is known only to the attacker.
- a3: An exploit that can be used to take advantage of a known vulnerability in the
    software or system.
- a4: A software vulnerability that has reached day 0 of its lifecycle.
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. The term "zero-day" has nothing to do with the timing of the attack
    during the month.
- a2: Correct. A zero-day exploit is a vulnerability in a system or software that
    is known only to the attacker and has not been publicly disclosed or patched.
    This makes it very difficult to defend against such attacks as there is no known
    solution or patch available to mitigate the exploit.
- a3: Incorrect. A known vulnerability in software or system is not classified as
    a zero-day exploit.
- a4: Incorrect. The lifecycle of software vulnerabilities has no relation to the
    term "zero-day."
