correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Changing passwords and PINs regularly is important, but it is not
    the key factor in preventing impersonation fraud.
- a2: Incorrect. Providing all requested information can actually make you more vulnerable
    to impersonation fraud.

    fraud. Always double check the identity of the person or entity making the request
    before providing any information or funds.

    practical, and does not necessarily prevent impersonation fraud.
