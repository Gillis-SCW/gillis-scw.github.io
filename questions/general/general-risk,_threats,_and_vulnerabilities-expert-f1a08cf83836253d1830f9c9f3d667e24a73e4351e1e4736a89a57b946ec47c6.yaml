question: What is the difference between an exploit and a payload in the context of
  cybersecurity?
answers:
- a1: An exploit refers to the delivery mechanism of a payload, while a payload is
    the malicious code that is executed on the target system.
- a2: An exploit is the malicious code that is executed on the target system, while
    a payload is the attack surface that is targeted by the exploit.
- a3: An exploit and a payload are the same thing.
- a4: An exploit is a physical attack, while a payload is a digital attack.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. An exploit is the code or mechanism that allows a threat actor to deliver
    and execute a payload, which is the malicious code that is executed on the target
    system. In other words, the exploit is the vehicle and the payload is the cargo.
- a2: Incorrect. An exploit is not the malicious code itself, but rather the code
    or mechanism that allows the payload to be delivered and executed on the target
    system.
- a3: Incorrect. An exploit and payload are distinct concepts.
- a4: Incorrect. Exploits and payloads are digital attacks, not physical ones.
