question: What is the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?
answers:
- a1: Vulnerability scanning is a process of identifying security weaknesses in networks,
    systems and applications. Penetration testing is a method used to exploit the
    vulnerabilities to assess the impact of an attack.
- a2: Vulnerability scanning is a method used to assess the impact of an attack. Penetration
    testing is a process of identifying security weaknesses in networks, systems and
    applications.
- a3: Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are the same thing.
- a4: None of the above.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. Vulnerability scanning is a process of scanning a target network, system
    or application to identify known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.
    Penetration testing, on the other hand, is the process of simulating a real-world
    attack on a network, system or application to identify security weaknesses and
    assess the impact of an attack.
- a2: Incorrect. The roles of vulnerability scanning and penetration testing mentioned
    in this option are reversed.
- a3: Incorrect. Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are two distinct processes
    with different goals and methodologies.
- a4: Incorrect. Option d provides no useful information regarding the difference
    between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
