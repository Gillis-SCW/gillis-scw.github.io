question: What is two-factor authentication and how does it help prevent account takeover?
answers:
- a: Two-factor authentication is the use of two different passwords for one account,
    making it more difficult for attackers to gain access.
- b: Two-factor authentication is the use of a password and a fingerprint or facial
    recognition scan to authenticate a user's identity.
- c: Two-factor authentication is the use of a password and a secondary device, such
    as a phone or token, to verify a user's identity.
- d: Two-factor authentication is a type of social engineering scam that targets users
    with multiple emails asking for their login credentials.
correct_answer: c
explanations:
- a: Incorrect. Two-factor authentication does involve two steps, but not two separate
    passwords.
- b: Incorrect. Biometric authentication can be part of two-factor authentication,
    but it is not the only method.
- c: Correct. Two-factor authentication involves entering a password and then using
    a secondary device, such as a phone or token, to further verify the user's identity.
    This prevents account takeover by making it much more difficult for a thief to
    access the account.
- d: Incorrect. Two-factor authentication is not a social engineering scam, but cyber
    criminals may use social engineering tactics to try to obtain login credentials.
