question: What is the difference between a virus and a Trojan horse in the context
  of email attachments?
answers:
- a1: A virus is designed to replicate itself and infect other systems, while a Trojan
    horse appears harmless but contains malicious code or instructions.
- a2: A virus is a type of malware that spreads through email attachments, while a
    Trojan horse is a software program that can perform various functions.
- a3: A virus can be detected and neutralized by antivirus software, while a Trojan
    horse is difficult to detect because it appears harmless.
- a4: A virus can self-replicate and spread across networks, while a Trojan horse
    requires user interaction to execute its malicious code.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. A virus is a piece of code or software that is designed to replicate
    itself and infect other systems, while a Trojan horse appears harmless or beneficial
    but contains malicious code or instructions that can cause harm or damage once
    executed. Both types of malware can be spread through email attachments.
- a2: Incorrect. This answer is partly correct. A virus is a type of malware that
    spreads through various methods, including email attachments, while a Trojan horse
    is a type of malware that tricks users into running it by appearing harmless or
    beneficial. However, it does not apply to the context of email attachments only.
- a3: Incorrect. This answer is partly correct. Viruses can often be detected and
    neutralized by antivirus software, while Trojan horses can sometimes evade detection
    because they appear harmless or beneficial. However, it does not address the differences
    between viruses and Trojan horses.
- a4: Incorrect. While viruses are self-replicating and can spread across networks,
    Trojan horses do not self-replicate or spread on their own and require user interaction
    to execute their malicious code. This answer does not address the differences
    between viruses and Trojan horses in the context of email attachments.
