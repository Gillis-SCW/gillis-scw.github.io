question: What are the best practices for testing a disaster recovery plan?
answers:
- a1: Conducting frequent risk assessments, testing backup strategies, and running
    tabletop simulations.
- a2: Running penetration testing, disaster simulation, and disrupting live systems
    to test recovery procedures.
- a3: Conducting financial audits, resource allocation optimization, and employee
    performance evaluations.
- a4: Conducting customer surveys, legal reviews, and regulatory inspections.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. The best practices for testing a disaster recovery plan are to conduct
    frequent risk assessments, test backup strategies, and run tabletop simulations.
    Regular testing identifies gaps and vulnerabilities and allows for necessary improvements.
    Running tabletop exercises that simulate emergencies allows key stakeholders to
    practice their roles and mitigate confusion in a real emergency situation.
- a2: Incorrect. While penetration testing, disaster simulation, and testing recovery
    procedures are important, disrupting live systems to test these procedures can
    have severe consequences.
- a3: Incorrect. Financial audits, resource allocation optimization, and employee
    evaluations are important business management practices but are not specific to
    disaster recovery.
- a4: Incorrect. Conducting customer surveys, legal reviews, and regulatory inspections
    are crucial in overall business management but are not specific to testing disaster
    recovery plans.
