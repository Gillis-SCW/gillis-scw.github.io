question: Which access control policy would be the most effective for remote workers
  who need to access sensitive company data?
answers:
- a1: Multi-factor authentication
- a2: Single sign-on
- a3: Password sharing
- a4: Guest accounts with limited access
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide two or more pieces
    of evidence to verify their identity, making it one of the most effective access
    control policies.
- a2: Partially correct. Single sign-on can make remote work easier but it is not
    the most secure access control policy.
- a3: Incorrect. Password sharing is not secure and should be avoided.
- a4: Incorrect. Guest accounts with limited access are useful for non-employees,
    but they should not be used for remote workers who need to access sensitive company
    data.
