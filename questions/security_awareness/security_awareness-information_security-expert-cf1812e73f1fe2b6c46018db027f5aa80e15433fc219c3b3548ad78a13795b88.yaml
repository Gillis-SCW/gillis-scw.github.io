question: What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
answers:
- a: Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric
    encryption uses different keys.
- b: Symmetric encryption is more secure than asymmetric encryption.
- c: Asymmetric encryption is faster than symmetric encryption.
- d: All of the above.
correct_answer: a
explanations:
- a: Correct. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption,
    while asymmetric encryption uses different keys.
- b: Incorrect. The security of encryption depends on the algorithm and key length
    used, not whether it is symmetric or asymmetric.
- c: Incorrect. Asymmetric encryption is generally slower than symmetric encryption
    due to the complexity of the key exchange process.
- d: Incorrect. Only option A is correct; options B and C are incorrect.
