correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Clicking on links in suspicious emails can lead to malware infections
    or other security issues.
- a2: Correct. Checking the sender's email address and comparing it to previous emails
    from the same sender can help verify if an email is authentic or if it is a phishing
    scam using a spoofed email address.
- a3: Incorrect. Replying to a suspicious email is not recommended as it can confirm
    to attackers that they have reached a valid email address.
- a4: Incorrect. Ignoring suspicious emails and deleting them is a good practice,
    but it does not help verify if they are authentic.
