correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Partially correct. A VPN can indeed provide extra security when accessing public
    wifi networks, but it has other uses as well.
- a2: Correct. A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for internet traffic, which
    helps protect against eavesdropping and other cyber attacks.
- a3: Incorrect. Scanning for and blocking malware is the responsibility of antivirus
    tools, not VPNs.
- a4: Incorrect. Encrypting files stored on the cloud is important, but it is not
    the purpose of a VPN.
