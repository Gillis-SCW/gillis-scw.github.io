question: What is the difference between data backups and data replication?
answers:
- a1: Data backups protect against accidental deletion, while data replication protects
    against hardware failure
- a2: Data backups create redundant copies, while data replication maintains a single
    copy
- a3: Data backups are offline, while data replication is online and real-time
- a4: Data backups create incremental copies, while data replication creates full
    copies
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Partially correct. Data backups do in fact protect against accidental deletion,
    but they can also prevent data loss from hardware failure and other disasters.
    Data replication can also protect against hardware failure.
- a2: Correct. Data backups create redundant copies of data at regular intervals,
    while data replication maintains a single copy of data that is constantly updated.
- a3: Incorrect. Both data backups and data replication can be performed online and
    in real-time or offline.
- a4: Incorrect. Data backups can be either full or incremental, while data replication
    always creates full copies.
