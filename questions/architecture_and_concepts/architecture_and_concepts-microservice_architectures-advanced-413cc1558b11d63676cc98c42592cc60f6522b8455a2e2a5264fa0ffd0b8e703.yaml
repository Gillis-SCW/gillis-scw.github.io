question: What are some common issues encountered when implementing microservice architectures?
answers:
- a1: Difficulty in maintaining data consistency across multiple services
- a2: Integration problems between different services
- a3: Increased complexity in deploying and running services
- a4: Security and safety concerns
correct_answer:
- a1
- a2
- a3
- a4
explanations:
- a1: Correct. With multiple services, maintaining data consistency across all of
    them can become more challenging.
- a2: Correct. Integrating different services can become difficult, as dependencies
    between services can make changes carried out to one service impact others.
- a3: Correct. Deploying and running services can be more intricate than in a monolithic
    application, as there is now a greater number of components that require maintenance
    and monitoring.
- a4: Correct. More services mean more microservices to secure, which may introduce
    problems around risk mitigation and safety concerns like system resilience.
