question: What is the difference between UDP and TCP and how are they used within
  communications architecture?
answers:
- a1: UDP provides connectionless communication and is used for streaming data, while
    TCP provides reliable, ordered data transmission and is used for applications
    that require high reliability.
- a2: UDP provides reliable, ordered data transmission and is used for applications
    that require high reliability, while TCP provides connectionless communication
    and is used for streaming data.
- a3: UDP and TCP provide the same services and are interchangeable within communications
    architecture.
- a4: UDP and TCP are both used for wireless communication and have no relevance in
    wired networks.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides connectionless communication
    that is unreliable but fast, making it useful for streaming real-time data like
    video and audio. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides reliable and ordered
    data transmission that is slower but ensures data integrity and completeness,
    making it useful for applications that require high reliability like web browsing
    or email.
- a2: Incorrect. This answer describes the opposite of the correct answer, confusing
    the services provided by UDP and TCP.
- a3: Incorrect. UDP and TCP provide different services and are not interchangeable
    within communications architecture.
- a4: Incorrect. UDP and TCP are used in both wireless and wired networks and have
    no relevance to the type of network used.
