question: What is the difference between mandatory access control (MAC) and discretionary
  access control (DAC)?
answers:
- a1: Only MAC provides the ability to grant access on a need-to-know basis, while
    DAC does not.
- a2: Only DAC provides the ability to grant access on a need-to-know basis, while
    MAC does not.
- a3: MAC is a more flexible approach to access control, while DAC is more rigid.
- a4: DAC is only used in environments where there are a small number of users or
    resources to control, while MAC is used in more complex environments.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. The main difference between MAC and DAC is that MAC provides the ability
    to grant access on a need-to-know basis, while DAC does not. In MAC, access is
    granted according to predefined policies that are set by an administrator. DAC,
    on the other hand, allows users to control access to their own resources and does
    not require administrators to set policies. This makes it less secure than MAC,
    as users may not know what the most secure settings are for their resources.
- a2: Incorrect. DAC does not provide the ability to grant access on a need-to-know
    basis, as users can grant access to their own resources regardless of whether
    or not the person requesting access actually needs it.
- a3: Incorrect. MAC and DAC are both flexible and rigid in different ways. While
    MAC is more rigid in that access is granted according to predefined policies,
    it is also more flexible as it can accommodate a wide range of environments and
    users. DAC, on the other hand, is more flexible in allowing users to grant access
    to their own resources, but it is more rigid in its lack of predefined policies.
- a4: Incorrect. MAC and DAC are both used in a variety of environments, regardless
    of the number of users or resources to control. The choice between the two depends
    on the specific needs and requirements of the organization or system.
