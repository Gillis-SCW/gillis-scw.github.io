level: intermediate
question: Which encryption algorithm is commonly used in Secure File Upload Architecture?
answers:
- a1: DES
- a2: AES
- a3: RSA
- a4: SHA
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. DES (Data Encryption Standard) is an outdated algorithm that has
    been compromised and is no longer considered secure enough for modern applications.
- a2: Correct. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used encryption algorithm
    that is considered very secure and is commonly used in Secure File Upload Architecture.
- a3: "Incorrect. RSA (Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman) is a public-key encryption\
    \ algorithm that is mainly used for secure data transmission, digital signatures,\
    \ and key exchange. It is not commonly used in Secure File Upload Architecture."
- a4: Incorrect. SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographic hash function that
    is used to secure data and electronic signatures, but not to encrypt files in
    transit.
