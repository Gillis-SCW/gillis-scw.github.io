question: What is a nonce in Secure File Upload Architecture?
answers:
- a1: A random string used only once to protect against replay attacks
- a2: A cryptographic hash that is used to encrypt the contents of the file
- a3: A private key used to encrypt and decrypt files during transmission
- a4: An authentication server that verifies the user's identity
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. A nonce is a random string that is used only once to protect against
    replay attacks, where an attacker tries to re-transmit a previously intercepted
    message.
- a2: Incorrect. A cryptographic hash is a one-way function that is used to ensure
    the integrity of data, but not to encrypt files during transmission.
- a3: Incorrect. A private key is used in asymmetric cryptography, but not in Secure
    File Upload Architecture, which typically uses symmetric encryption.
- a4: Incorrect. An authentication server is used to verify a user's identity, but
    it is not related to nonce-based security measures.
