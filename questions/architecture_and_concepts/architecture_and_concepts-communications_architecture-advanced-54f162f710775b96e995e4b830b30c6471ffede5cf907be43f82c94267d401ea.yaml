question: What is the OSI model and how does it relate to communications architecture?
answers:
- a1: The OSI model is a networking model that defines how data is transmitted over
    a network, and it is an important part of communications architecture.
- a2: The OSI model is a security protocol used to protect data during transmission.
- a3: The OSI model is a type of network architecture used for large-scale enterprise
    networks.
- a4: The OSI model is a type of wireless technology used for local area networks.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a framework that defines
    how data is transmitted over a network. It is an important part of communications
    architecture because it provides a standard for how communication systems can
    work together, which ensures interoperability and flexibility.
- a2: Incorrect. The OSI model is not a security protocol but includes security measures
    as a part of its framework.
- a3: Incorrect. The OSI model is not a type of network architecture but is a theoretical
    framework for how networks can work together.
- a4: Incorrect. The OSI model is not a type of wireless technology but is a framework
    for how communication occurs over a network.
