    balance of design.
correct_answer: a3
explanations:

    a design, so the focal point must have some connection to the rest of the design.
- a2: Incorrect. Although the focal point is essential in directing all aspects of
    the design, it is not the only thing that connects the other elements.

    between all of the elements, working together to create a harmonious and cohesive
    structure.
- a4: Incorrect. In Complete Mediation, all elements must be connected, including
    the focal point.
