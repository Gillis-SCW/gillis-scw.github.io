question: What is a "dropper" in the context of malware?
answers:
- a1: A type of malware that opens a backdoor into a system for attackers to exploit
- a2: A technique used by malware to evade detection by security software
- a3: A standalone program that installs other malware onto a system
- a4: A form of ransomware that encrypts the entire hard drive instead of individual
    files
correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. The backdoor refers to a vulnerability in a system that attackers
    can use to gain unauthorized access, but not to the dropper itself.
- a2: Incorrect. Malware can use a variety of techniques to evade detection, but droppers
    specifically refer to a type of program that installs other malware onto a system.
- a3: Correct. A dropper is a standalone program that installs other malware onto
    a system. It can be designed to be undetectable by security programs, making it
    especially dangerous.
- a4: Incorrect. Full disk encryption is a technique used by some malware to make
    the target machine inaccessible, but it is not specific to ransomware.
