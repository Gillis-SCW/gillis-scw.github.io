question: What is the difference between role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based
  access control (ABAC)?
answers:
- a1: RBAC is more flexible than ABAC, as it allows roles to be assigned based on
    individual users, while ABAC only allows roles to be assigned based on attributes.
- a2: ABAC is more flexible than RBAC, as it allows access to be granted based on
    individual attributes rather than pre-defined roles.
- a3: Both RBAC and ABAC are similar in that they allow access to be granted based
    on predefined policies, but RBAC is more common in larger organizations while
    ABAC is more common in smaller organizations.
- a4: RBAC and ABAC are interchangeable concepts and are both used to refer to the
    same cybersecurity practice.
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. While RBAC is a flexible approach that allows roles to be assigned
    to individual users based on their responsibilities, this is not a feature of
    ABAC. ABAC, on the other hand, allows access to be granted based on individual
    attributes such as job function, location, or time of day.
- a2: Correct. The main difference between RBAC and ABAC is that RBAC is role-based,
    while ABAC is attribute-based. This means that RBAC grants access to users based
    on predefined roles that match their job functions or responsibilities, while
    ABAC grants access based on individual attributes such as department, job function,
    or clearance level. ABAC is more flexible than RBAC because it allows access to
    be granted based on multiple attributes rather than pre-defined roles.
- a3: Incorrect. There is no correlation between the size of an organization and the
    access control approach it employs. Both RBAC and ABAC are used in organizations
    of all sizes, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the system or
    environment.
- a4: Incorrect. While RBAC and ABAC are both access control concepts, they are not
    interchangeable terms as they refer to different approaches. RBAC grants access
    based on predefined roles, while ABAC grants access based on individual attributes.
