question: What is the difference between an active and a passive layer in a Defense
  in Depth approach?
answers:
- a: An active layer is proactive and can detect and respond to an attack in real-time,
    while a passive layer is only reactive.
- b: A passive layer is more effective than an active layer because it doesn't rely
    on any human intervention.
- c: An active layer is only effective against known attacks, while a passive layer
    can protect against unknown attacks.
- d: A passive layer is more expensive than an active layer because it requires more
    hardware.
correct_answer: a
explanations:
- a: Correct. Active layers, such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and security
    information and event management (SIEM), can detect and respond to an attack in
    real-time, while passive layers, such as firewalls and access control, are only
    reactive.
- b: Incorrect. A passive layer still requires some human intervention and can be
    less effective against certain types of attacks.
- c: Incorrect. An active layer can also protect against unknown attacks with the
    help of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- d: Incorrect. The cost of a layer depends on multiple factors and is not determined
    by whether it is active or passive.
