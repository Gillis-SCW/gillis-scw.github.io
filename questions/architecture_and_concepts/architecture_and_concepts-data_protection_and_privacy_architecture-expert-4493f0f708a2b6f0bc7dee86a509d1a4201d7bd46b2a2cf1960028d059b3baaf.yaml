question: What is the difference between anonymization and pseudonymization of personal
  data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?
answers:
- a: Anonymization destroys any means of association between personal data and its
    owner, while pseudonymization replaces directly identifying attributes with another
    identifier
- b: Anonymization is only applicable to sensitive data types, while pseudonymization
    is applied to all data types
- c: Anonymization is not recognized as a viable protection measure under GDPR, pseudonymization
    is the only recognized protection measure
- d: Both terms refer to different means of data encryption to prevent unauthorized
    access
correct_answer: a
explanations:
- a: Correct. Anonymization completely removes any means of association between personal
    data and its owner, while pseudonymization substitutes directly identifying attributes
    with another identifier, making re-identification more difficult.
- b: Incorrect. Anonymization can be applied to all types of personal data, not just
    sensitive data types.
- c: Incorrect. Anonymization is recognized under GDPR as a viable means of protecting
    personal data, alongside pseudonymization and encryption.
- d: Incorrect. While both anonymization and pseudonymization are related to data
    protection, they are not means of encryption.
