question: What is the main advantage of using a microservice architecture?
answers:
- a1: Improved scalability of the system
- a2: Elimination of code complexity
- a3: Better performance of the system
- a4: Reduced development time
correct_answer:
- a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. The microservice architecture approach makes it possible for individual
    parts of an application's functionality to scale up or down based on demand, thereby
    making it more scalable.
- a2: Incorrect. Microservices break down the code into smaller, less complex components,
    but this does not eliminate code complexity entirely.
- a3: Incorrect. While performance may be better in certain cases, scalability is
    the main advantage.
- a4: Incorrect. Although independent services may be available for deployment, development
    of a microservice architecture typically takes longer to complete.
