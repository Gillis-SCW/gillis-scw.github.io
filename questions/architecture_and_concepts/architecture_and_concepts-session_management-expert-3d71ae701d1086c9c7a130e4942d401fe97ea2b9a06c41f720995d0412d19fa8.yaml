question: What is the risk of session fixation, and how can it be prevented?
answers:
- a1: Session fixation is the risk of an attacker initiating a user session and then
    hijacking it, which can be prevented by using anti-CSRF tokens
- a2: Session fixation is the risk of an attacker passing their own session token
    to a user, which can be prevented by regenerating session identifiers upon authentication
- a3: Session fixation is the risk of an attacker intercepting a user's session token,
    which can be prevented by using server-side session storage instead of cookies
- a4: Session fixation is the risk of a user's session staying active after logout,
    which can be prevented by implementing proper cache control headers
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Session fixation is the risk of an attacker tricking a user into
    using a session with a known identifier, which can be prevented by using session
    IDs which are regenerated upon authentication.
- a2: Correct. Session fixation is the risk of an attacker passing their own session
    token to a user, which can be prevented by regenerating session identifiers upon
    authentication.
- a3: Incorrect. Session hijacking is the risk of an attacker intercepting a user's
    session token, not session fixation. Server-side session storage may improve security,
    but it does not prevent session fixation.
- a4: Incorrect. Proper cache control headers can help prevent unauthorized access
    to cached resources, but they do not prevent session fixation.
