question: What is Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)?
answers:
- a1: A principle of RESTful architecture that requires each request to contain all
    the necessary information.
- a2: A tool used for service discovery and registration, load balancing, and routing.
- a3: A way to enable the server to instruct clients about available actions and state
    transitions.
- a4: A security protocol used for encrypting and authenticating API requests and
    responses.
correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. While this is a principle of RESTful architecture, it's not specifically
    related to HATEOAS.
- a2: Incorrect. This sounds like a description of a service mesh, which is not specifically
    related to HATEOAS.
- a3: Correct! HATEOAS is a way to enable the server to instruct clients about available
    actions and state transitions. This helps to make the API more self-descriptive,
    and can reduce the amount of coupling between the client and server.
- a4: Incorrect. This sounds like a description of HTTPS, which is not specifically
    related to HATEOAS.
