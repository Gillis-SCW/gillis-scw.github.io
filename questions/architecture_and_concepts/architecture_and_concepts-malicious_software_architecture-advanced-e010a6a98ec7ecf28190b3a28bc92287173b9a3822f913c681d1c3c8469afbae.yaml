question: What is steganography-based malware?
answers:
- a1: Malware that uses encryption to hide its malicious behavior
- a2: Malware that hides its code within image files or other innocuous data
- a3: Malware that exploits vulnerabilities in network protocols
- a4: Malware that operates by creating clones of legitimate programs
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Encryption-based malware uses encryption to protect its malicious
    code from detection, but not to hide it completely.
- a2: Correct. Steganography-based malware is malware that hides its code within image
    files or other innocuous data. This makes it difficult to detect through traditional
    security measures that only scan for known malware signatures.
- a3: Incorrect. Network protocol-based malware exploits vulnerabilities in network
    protocols to attack a system or steal data, but does not necessarily involve hiding
    its code within other data.
- a4: Incorrect. Clone-based malware operates by imitating legitimate programs in
    order to bypass security checks, but does not necessarily involve hiding its code
    within other data.
