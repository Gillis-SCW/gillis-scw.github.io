level: expert
question: How can a security architect implement both fail secure and fail safe approaches
  in a single security system?
answers:
- a1: By using separate systems for fail secure and fail safe components
- a2: By using integrated systems that combine fail secure and fail safe approaches
- a3: By prioritizing either fail secure or fail safe over the other
- a4: By only implementing fail secure or fail safe, but not both
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Separating fail secure and fail safe components may create complexities
    in managing the system and could lead to gaps in security.
- a2: Correct. Integrated systems that combine both approaches can provide a comprehensive
    and efficient solution with the benefits of each approach.
- a3: Incorrect. Prioritizing one approach over the other may not provide the best
    solution for the security system as a whole.
- a4: Incorrect. Ignoring either fail secure or fail safe can leave the security system
    vulnerable. A comprehensive approach should consider both.
