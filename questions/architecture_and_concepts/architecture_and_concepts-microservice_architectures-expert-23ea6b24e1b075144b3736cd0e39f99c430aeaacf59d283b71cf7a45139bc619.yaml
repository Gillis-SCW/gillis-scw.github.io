question: What is the role of an API gateway in a microservice architecture?
answers:
- a1: To manage access control among different services
- a2: To provide a single entry point for external requests
- a3: To translate data format between services
- a4: To monitor the health of all the services
correct_answer:
- a1
- a2
- a3
explanations:
- a1: Correct. The API gateway helps to control access and ensure there are no unauthorized
    activities in the microservice architecture. It routes requests to the appropriate
    microservice and translates those requests if necessary.
- a2: Correct. The API gateway serves as the single entry point into the microservice
    architecture and routes requests to their appropriate service. It also handles
    load balancing and rate limiting for incoming requests.
- a3: Correct. If services use different data formats or protocols, the API gateway
    can perform data mapping and transformation to ensure both communication and data
    exchange are successful.
- a4: Incorrect. Although monitoring is important in a microservice architecture,
    the API gateway is not primarily responsible for it. Monitoring typically falls
    under the responsibility of a service mesh or observability tool.
