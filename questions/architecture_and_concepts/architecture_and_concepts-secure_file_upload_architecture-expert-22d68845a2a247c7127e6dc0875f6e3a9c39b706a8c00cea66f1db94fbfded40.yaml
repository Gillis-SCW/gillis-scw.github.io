question: Can Secure File Upload Architecture provide end-to-end encryption?
answers:
- a1: Yes, if the client encrypts the file using a public key provided by the server
- a2: Yes, if the server decrypts the file using a private key provided by the client
- a3: No, because the server needs to be able to read and process the file
- a4: No, because end-to-end encryption is not possible in a client-server architecture
correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. If the client encrypts the file using a public key provided by the
    server, it means that the server can also decrypt the file, so this is not true
    end-to-end encryption.
- a2: Incorrect. If the server decrypts the file using a private key provided by the
    client, it means that the client has to trust the server with their private key,
    which defeats the purpose of end-to-end encryption.
- a3: Correct. Secure File Upload Architecture cannot provide true end-to-end encryption,
    because the server needs to be able to read and process the file, which means
    that it has access to the unencrypted data while it is in transit.
- a4: Incorrect. While it is true that end-to-end encryption is more difficult to
    achieve in a client-server architecture, it is not impossible with the proper
    implementation of technologies such as TLS and HTTPS. However, it is still not
    possible to achieve true end-to-end encryption in Secure File Upload Architecture
    because of the need for the server to access the unencrypted data.
