question: What is the difference between business logic and business rules?
answers:
- a1: Business logic refers to the overall architecture of a software system, while
    business rules are the specific guidelines for how to handle data and transactions.
- a2: Business logic refers to the way in which business rules are implemented within
    a software system, while business rules provide the specific parameters for how
    the system should operate.
- a3: Business logic refers to the algorithms and decision-making capabilities of
    a software system, while business rules are the specific procedures and policies
    that guide how the system should behave.
- a4: Business logic refers to the performance and functionality of a software system,
    while business rules provide the specific requirements for how the system should
    operate.
correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. While business rules are a specific part of Business Logic Architecture,
    business logic is not defined solely by the guidelines for how to handle data
    and transactions.
- a2: Incorrect. Business logic is not defined solely by the way in which business
    rules are implemented within a software system.
- a3: Correct. Business logic refers to the algorithms and decision-making capabilities
    of a software system and how it handles inputs and outputs, while business rules
    are the specific procedures and policies that guide how the system should behave
    based on those inputs and outputs.
- a4: Incorrect. Business logic is not defined solely by the performance and functionality
    of a software system.
