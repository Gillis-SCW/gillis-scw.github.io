question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using secure cookies for session
  management?
answers:
- a1: They can be encrypted, but can still be vulnerable to attacks like cross-site
    scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- a2: They can be used to store session data client-side, but can increase the risk
    of data theft
- a3: They can be accessed via JavaScript, but not by other domains, limiting the
    risk of unauthorized access
- a4: They can be set to expire after a certain time, but can still be vulnerable
    to replay attacks
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. Secure cookies can be encrypted to improve security, but can still
    be vulnerable to attacks like XSS and CSRF.
- a2: Incorrect. Secure cookies are not primarily used for storing session data client-side,
    but rather for identifying and authenticating users.
- a3: Incorrect. Secure cookies can indeed be accessed by other domains through JavaScript,
    but they can also be vulnerable to other security risks.
- a4: Incorrect. Secure cookies can be set to expire after a certain time to improve
    security, but they are not vulnerable to replay attacks.
