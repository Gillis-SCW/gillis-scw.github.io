question: What is the purpose of limiting session lifetimes?
answers:
- a1: To force users to frequently re-authenticate
- a2: To reduce the risk of session hijacking
- a3: To prevent unauthorized access by expired sessions
- a4: To reduce server load caused by idle sessions
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Limiting session lifetimes may not necessarily force users to frequently
    re-authenticate.
- a2: Correct. Limiting session lifetimes reduces the risk of session hijacking by
    limiting the period of time during which a session can be used to gain unauthorized
    access.
- a3: Incorrect. Limiting session lifetimes does not necessarily prevent unauthorized
    access by expired sessions, but it can help reduce the risk.
- a4: Incorrect. Limiting session lifetimes is not primarily done to reduce server
    load caused by idle sessions, but rather to improve security.
