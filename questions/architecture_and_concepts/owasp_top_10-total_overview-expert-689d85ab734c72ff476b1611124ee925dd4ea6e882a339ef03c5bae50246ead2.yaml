question: Which of the following best describes Insufficient Logging and Monitoring?
answers:
- a1: The use of unencrypted communication channels of confidential data, such as
    user credentials
- a2: The failure to limit the impact of a vulnerability or attack, through proper
    isolation or compartmentalization
- a3: The lack of proper testing or quality control to detect and prevent vulnerabilities
    in software or hardware
- a4: The inability to detect or trace security events, such as unauthorized access
    or data leakage, in real-time
correct_answer: a4
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. The use of unencrypted communication channels is part of A6-Security
    Misconfigurations.
- a2: Incorrect. Failure to limit impact is part of A3-Security Misconfigurations.
- a3: Incorrect. Lack of proper testing and quality control is part of A9-Using Components
    with Known Vulnerabilities.
- a4: Correct. Insufficient logging and monitoring refers to the inability to detect
    or trace security events, such as unauthorized or unexpected accesses or changes
    to the system or data, in real-time or near real-time. Without proper logging
    and monitoring, it is very difficult to detect and prevent attacks, and to respond
    or investigate compromised systems.
