question: How can session hijacking be prevented?
answers:
- a1: Using SSL/TLS encryption
- a2: Implementing secure cookie settings
- a3: Using session tokens to identify users
- a4: All of the above
correct_answer: a4
explanations:
- a1: Partially correct. While SSL/TLS encryption can prevent some forms of session
    hijacking, it is not a complete solution.
- a2: Partially correct. Secure cookie settings can help prevent session hijacking
    but may not be enough on their own.
- a3: Partially correct. Session tokens are one tool used to prevent session hijacking
    but are not the only solution.
- a4: Correct. Using a combination of SSL/TLS encryption, secure cookie settings,
    and session tokens can provide a more comprehensive approach to preventing session
    hijacking.
