question: Why is attention to detail critical when applying Complete Mediation in
  a design?
answers:
- a1: The design will not function if it is not executed with precision.
- a2: The design will be too expensive if not enough detail is paid to it.
- a3: Complete Mediation designs are hard to execute, requiring a lot of detail work.
- a4: Without enough attention to detail, the space will not look aesthetically pleasing.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. Because Complete Mediation involves linking all of the aspects of a
    design, careful planning and execution is necessary for the design to function
    properly.
- a2: Incorrect. The cost of the design is not directly affected if enough attention
    is not paid to the details.
- a3: Incorrect. Complete Mediation can be challenging, but it is the connection between
    the elements of the design that is important, not the detail work itself.
- a4: Incorrect. Although aesthetics is an important part of design, it is not the
    only reason that attention to detail is critical in Complete Mediation.
