question: Which of the following is NOT an impact of Insecure Direct Object References?
answers:
- a1: Impersonation
- a2: Data Leakage or Loss
- a3: Elevation of Privilege
- a4: Denial of Service
correct_answer: a4
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. An attacker can use insecure direct object references to access and
    modify data belonging to other users or system roles, allowing them to impersonate
    that user or role.
- a2: Incorrect. Insecure direct object references can expose sensitive data, such
    as personal or financial information, that can be leaked or lost to unauthorized
    entities.
- a3: Incorrect. By exploiting insecure direct object references, an attacker can
    gain elevated permissions or access, enabling them to perform actions they are
    not authorized to do, such as changing passwords or configurations.
- a4: Correct. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks refer to the intentional or accidental
    disruption or slowdown of a system or network, in order to prevent legitimate
    users from accessing resources. DoS attacks are not related to insecure direct
    object references.
