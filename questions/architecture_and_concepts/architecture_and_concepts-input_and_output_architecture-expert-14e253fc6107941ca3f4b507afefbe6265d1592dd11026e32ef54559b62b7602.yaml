question: What are some factors to consider when designing input/output architecture
  for a high-performance computing system?
answers:
- a1: The type and amount of data being transferred
- a2: The speed and bandwidth of the communication channels between devices
- a3: The reliability and fault tolerance of the system
- a4: All of the above
correct_answer: a4
explanations:
- a1: Partially correct. The type and amount of data being transferred is an important
    factor to consider in input/output architecture design.
- a2: Partially correct. The speed and bandwidth of communication channels can greatly
    affect the performance of a high-performance computing system.
- a3: Partially correct. The reliability and fault tolerance of the system are important
    considerations for high-performance computing, especially in mission-critical
    applications.
- a4: Correct. All of the listed factors must be considered in the design of input/output
    architecture for a high-performance computing system.
