level: beginner
question: What is a microservice architecture?
answers:
- a1: An approach in software development where applications are composed of small,
    independent services that communicate with each other through APIs.
- a2: A software architecture where all services are combined into a monolithic application.
- a3: An approach where applications are developed by one person instead of a team.
- a4: A software architecture where services are developed and managed by separate
    companies.
correct_answer:
- a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. In a microservice architecture, applications are made up of smaller
    services that interact with each other through APIs, allowing them to be developed,
    deployed and scaled independently.
- a2: Incorrect. A monolithic application has all services combined while a microservice
    architecture involves the breaking down of applications into smaller, independent
    services.
- a3: Incorrect. A single person developing an application does not constitute a microservice
    architecture.
- a4: Incorrect. Services are developed and managed by the same company in a microservice
    architecture.
