correct_answer: a4
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. The use of components with known vulnerabilities is part of the A9-Using
    Components with Known Vulnerabilities - in the OWASP Top 10.
- a2: Incorrect. Failure to restrict access is part of A2-Broken Authentication and
    Session Management.
- a3: Incorrect. Lack of access control is part of A5-Sensitive Data Exposure.
- a4: Correct. Security misconfiguration refers to the weak configuration of security
    measures, such as the use of default accounts and passwords, exposed error messages,
    open debugging or QA tools, unnecessary services running, or improper file and
    directory permissions. These misconfigurations can give an attacker easy access
    to sensitive data or critical system resources.
