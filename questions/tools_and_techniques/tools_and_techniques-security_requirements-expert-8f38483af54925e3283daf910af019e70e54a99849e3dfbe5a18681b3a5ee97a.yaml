question: What is the difference between confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  as they relate to security requirements?
answers:
- a1: Confidentiality ensures that data is accessed only by authorized individuals
    or systems, integrity ensures that data is accurate and not tampered with, and
    availability ensures that data is accessible when needed.
- a2: Confidentiality ensures that data is backed up in multiple locations, integrity
    ensures that data can be recovered if lost, and availability ensures that data
    can be restored quickly in the event of an outage.
- a3: Confidentiality ensures that data is encrypted during transmission and storage,
    integrity ensures that data is kept up to date, and availability ensures that
    data can be accessed remotely.
- a4: Confidentiality ensures that data is available to anyone who needs it, integrity
    ensures that data is stored in a secure location, and availability ensures that
    data is always up to date.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct - Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are often referred to
    as the CIA triad of security requirements, where confidentiality ensures only
    authorized access, integrity ensures accuracy and completeness, and availability
    ensures accessibility when needed.
- a2: Incorrect - Confidentiality does not necessarily ensure that data is backed
    up in multiple locations. While availability does relate to quick restoration
    after an outage, this is not its only purpose.
- a3: Incorrect - Confidentiality is not just about encryption, but about access control
    as well. Integrity is about maintaining data accuracy, not just keeping it up
    to date. Availability is not just about remote access, but also local access.
- a4: Incorrect - Confidentiality does not mean making data available to anyone who
    needs it, but instead limiting access to authorized individuals or systems. Integrity
    refers to accurate data, not just secure storage. Availability does not ensure
    that data is always up to date.
