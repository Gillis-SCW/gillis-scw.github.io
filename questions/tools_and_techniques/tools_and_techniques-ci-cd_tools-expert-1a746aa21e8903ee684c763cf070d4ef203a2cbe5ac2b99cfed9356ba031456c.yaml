question: What is GitOps and how does it relate to CI/CD?
answers:
- a1: GitOps is an approach to managing infrastructure using Git, and it's used in
    conjunction with CI/CD to automate infrastructure changes along with code changes.
- a2: GitOps is a particular CI/CD tool that integrates with Git repositories, enabling
    automatic testing and deployment of changes.
- a3: GitOps is a workflow for using Git branches to manage different versions of
    code and easily coordinate deployment across teams. It's used with CI/CD tools
    to ensure timely delivery of updates.
- a4: GitOps is a methodology that combines Git version control with DevOps practices,
    including CI/CD. It enables infrastructure as code in a way that's easily repeatable
    and verifiable.
correct_answer:
- a4
explanations:
- a1: Close, but not quite. GitOps is a methodology, not just a tool or approach to
    infrastructure management.
- a2: Incorrect. GitOps is not a specific tool, but rather a methodology that can
    be used with a variety of CI/CD tools.
- a3: This is not an accurate description of GitOps. While Git branches and version
    control are useful aspects of GitOps, it goes beyond coordination and delivery
    of code.
- a4: Correct! GitOps is a methodology that combines Git version control with DevOps
    practices, including CI/CD. It's used to enable infrastructure as code that can
    be easily repeated and verified.
