question: Which technique is used in architecture assessment to analyze the system's
  behavior under different operating conditions?
answers:
- a1: Modeling and simulation
- a2: Fault trees
- a3: Fault injection
- a4: Performance analysis
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. Modeling and simulation techniques are used in architecture assessment
    to analyze the system's behavior under different operating conditions.
- a2: Fault trees technique is used for safety and quality analysis, but it is not
    directly related to architecture assessment.
- a3: Fault injection technique is used for testing and debugging purposes, but it
    is not directly related to architecture assessment.
- a4: "Performance analysis technique is used to evaluate the software\u2019s responsiveness\
    \ and speed, but it is not directly related to architecture assessment."
