correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. While threat intelligence can provide alerts on potential security
    threats and vulnerabilities, this is not its primary role in incident response.
- a2: Correct. Threat intelligence can help incident responders better understand
    the nature and scope of the incident, as well as the motivations and tactics of
    the attackers. This can lead to better containment and eradication of the incident
    and more effective prevention of future incidents.

    important part of incident response, but threat intelligence is not the primary
    tool for this task.

    its role in incident response is broader than just containment and eradication.
    Threat intelligence can also help with situational awareness, incident reporting,
    and risk assessment.
