category: Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
level: advanced
question: What is code coverage analysis and why is it important in SAST?
answers:
- a1: Code coverage analysis measures the amount of code that has been tested and
    is important for identifying untested, potentially risky code.
- a2: Code coverage analysis measures the number of vulnerabilities present in the
    code and is important for determining how secure the application is.
- a3: Code coverage analysis measures the effectiveness of SAST tools and is important
    for selecting the right tool for a project.
- a4: Code coverage analysis measures the speed of code execution and is important
    for optimizing application performance.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. Code coverage analysis is used to measure the amount of code that has
    been tested and identify untested code that may contain potential security risks.
- a2: Incorrect. Code coverage analysis does not measure the number of vulnerabilities
    present in code, but instead evaluates the extent to which code has been tested.
- a3: Incorrect. Code coverage analysis does not measure the effectiveness of SAST
    tools but instead evaluates the test coverage of code.
- a4: Incorrect. Code coverage analysis does not measure the speed of code execution,
    but instead evaluates the extent to which code has been tested.
