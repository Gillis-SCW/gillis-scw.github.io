question: What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
answers:
- a1: Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while
    asymmetric uses different keys.
- a2: Symmetric encryption is faster than asymmetric encryption.
- a3: Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption.
- a4: Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption use the same key for encryption and
    decryption.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct! Symmetric encryption uses one key for both encryption and decryption,
    while asymmetric encryption uses different keys.
- a2: Incorrect. Symmetric encryption is generally faster, but it is less secure than
    asymmetric encryption.
- a3: Incorrect. Asymmetric encryption is more secure, but it is slower than symmetric
    encryption.
- a4: Incorrect. Symmetric encryption uses one key for both encryption and decryption,
    while asymmetric encryption uses different keys.
