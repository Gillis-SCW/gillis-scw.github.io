level: advanced
question: In what ways does IAST reduce the number of false positives compared to
  SAST and DAST?
answers:
- a: IAST uses runtime data to identify specific code paths that are vulnerable and
    avoids generic false positives that can occur in SAST and DAST.
- b: IAST uses static analysis to analyze the application's source code and reduces
    false positives by analyzing the code's intent.
- c: IAST uses dynamic analysis to test the application's runtime and detects false
    positives generated by SAST and DAST.
- d: IAST does not reduce false positives compared to SAST and DAST.
correct_answer: a
explanations:
- a: Correct! IAST uses runtime data to identify specific code paths that are vulnerable,
    avoiding generic false positives that can occur in SAST and DAST.
- b: Incorrect. This describes the benefits of SAST, not IAST. IAST is concerned with
    runtime security testing, not static analysis.
- c: Incorrect. This describes the benefits of DAST, not IAST. IAST is concerned with
    real-time security testing, not dynamic analysis.
- d: Incorrect. IAST does reduce false positives compared to SAST and DAST by avoiding
    generic false positives that can occur with these techniques.
