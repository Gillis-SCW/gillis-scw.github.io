question: What is a side-channel attack in the context of encryption?
answers:
- a1: An attack that exploits weaknesses in the encryption algorithm itself.
- a2: An attack that exploits weaknesses in the encryption key.
- a3: An attack that exploits information leaked by the system performing the encryption.
- a4: An attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the network between the sender and
    receiver.
correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. This refers to a cryptographic attack.
- a2: Incorrect. This refers to a key-based attack.
- a3: Correct! Side-channel attacks exploit information leaked by the system performing
    the encryption, such as the power consumption or electromagnetic radiation emitted
    during encryption.
- a4: Incorrect. This refers to a network-based attack.
