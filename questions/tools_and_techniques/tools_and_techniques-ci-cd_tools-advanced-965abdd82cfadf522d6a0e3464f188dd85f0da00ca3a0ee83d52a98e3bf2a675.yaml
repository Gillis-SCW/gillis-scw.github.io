question: What is the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery?
answers:
- a1: Continuous Integration is the automatic building and testing of code when changes
    are made, while Continuous Delivery is the automatic deployment of code changes
    to the production environment.
- a2: Continuous Integration is the continuous deployment of code changes, while Continuous
    Delivery is the continuous testing of code changes.
- a3: Continuous Integration is the automatic building and testing of code when changes
    are made, while Continuous Delivery includes both automatic testing and deployment
    of changes.
- a4: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are the same thing, just different
    terms used by different tools.
correct_answer:
- a3
explanations:
- a1: Close, but not quite. Continuous Delivery does include the automatic deployment
    of code changes, but it's not exclusively the only thing it encompasses.
- a2: Incorrect. Continuous Integration is specifically focused on building and testing
    code, not deployment.
- a3: Correct! Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery both involve the automatic
    building and testing of code, but Continuous Delivery also includes automatic
    deployment of changes.
- a4: This is not true. While different tools may use different terminology or have
    slightly different approaches to CI/CD, the basic concepts are consistent.
