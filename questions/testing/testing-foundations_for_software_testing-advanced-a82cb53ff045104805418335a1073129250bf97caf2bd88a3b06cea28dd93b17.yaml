question: What is a boundary value analysis?
answers:
- a1: It is a technique for finding errors in software systems by testing input and
    output values that lie on the edges or outside of input domain boundaries.
- a2: It is a technique for finding errors in software systems by testing random input
    and output values that have never been tested before.
- a3: It is a technique for finding errors in software systems by testing input and
    output values that are commonly used by end-users.
- a4: It is a technique for finding errors in software systems by testing input and
    output values that are frequently updated by developers.
correct_answer: a1
explanations:
- a1: Correct. Boundary value analysis is a technique for finding errors in software
    systems by testing input and output values that lie on the edges or outside of
    input domain boundaries.
- a2: Incorrect. Random testing is a technique for finding errors in software systems
    by testing random input and output values that have never been tested before.
- a3: Incorrect. User-based testing is a technique for finding errors in software
    systems by testing input and output values that are commonly used by end-users.
- a4: Incorrect. Testing frequently updated input and output values does not guarantee
    the discovery of errors in software systems.
