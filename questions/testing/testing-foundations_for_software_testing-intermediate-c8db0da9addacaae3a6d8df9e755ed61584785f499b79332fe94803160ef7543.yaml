question: What is the difference between verification and validation?
answers:
- a1: Verification is the process of evaluating a system or component to check it
    meets its specification, while validation is the process of evaluating a system
    or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether
    it satisfies specified requirements.
- a2: Verification is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at
    the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified
    requirements, while validation is the process of evaluating a system or component
    to check it meets its specification.
- a3: Verification and validation both mean the same thing.
- a4: Verification is the process of testing individual components of a system, while
    validation is the process of testing the entire system.
