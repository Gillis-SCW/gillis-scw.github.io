    organizations
correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Double extortion does not refer to an encryption algorithm used by
    ransomware creators.
- a2: Incorrect. Double extortion refers to a single ransom payment demanded under
    threat of publishing stolen data, as opposed to demanding a separate payment for
    not publishing the data.
- a3: Correct. Double extortion occurs when ransomware creators not only encrypt a
    victim's data, but also upload copies of the data to a remote server before encrypting
    it. This allows them to demand payment for both the decryption key and the return
    of the stolen data.
- a4: Incorrect. "Double extortion" does not refer to a specific target of ransomware
    attacks.
