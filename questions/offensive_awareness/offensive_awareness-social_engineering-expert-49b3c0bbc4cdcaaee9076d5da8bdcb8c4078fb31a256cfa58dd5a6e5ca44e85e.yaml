question: What is pretexting in Social Engineering?
answers:
- a1: A type of phishing attack.
- a2: A way to impersonate someone else in order to gain information.
- a3: A way to exploit someone's trust in a position of authority.
- a4: A way to use reverse social engineering to gain access to a system.
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Pretexting is not a type of phishing attack.
- a2: Correct. Pretexting involves creating a false pretense or persona in order to
    trick someone into divulging information or taking an action they wouldn't normally
    take.
- a3: Incorrect. While exploiting trust in authority is a common tactic in Social
    Engineering, it is not specific to pretexting.
- a4: Incorrect. Reverse social engineering involves the attacker creating the pretense
    of needing help or being a victim in order to trick the target into providing
    information or access. Pretexting is different, as it involves the attacker creating
    a false persona to gain information or access.
