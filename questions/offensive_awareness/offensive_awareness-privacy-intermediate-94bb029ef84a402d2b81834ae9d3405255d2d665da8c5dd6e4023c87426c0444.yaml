question: What is the most secure way to store passwords?
answers:
- a1: Writing them on a piece of paper and keeping it in a safe place.
- a2: Using a password management tool.
- a3: Using the same password for all accounts to remember it easily.
- a4: Sharing passwords with trusted individuals.
correct_answer: a2
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Writing passwords on paper can still pose a security risk if the
    paper is lost or stolen, and keeping it in a safe place may not always be easily
    accessible.
- a2: Correct. Password management tools securely store and encrypt passwords, allowing
    individuals to use unique and complex passwords for each account without having
    to remember them all.
- a3: Incorrect. Using the same password for all accounts increases the risk of multiple
    accounts being compromised if one password is exposed.
- a4: Incorrect. Sharing passwords with others, even trusted individuals, can increase
    the risk of the password being compromised or misused.
