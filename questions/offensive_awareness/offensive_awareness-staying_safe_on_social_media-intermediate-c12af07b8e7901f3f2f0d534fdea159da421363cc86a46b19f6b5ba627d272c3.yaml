correct_answer: a3
explanations:
- a1: Incorrect. Blocking the offender is a good start, but it doesn't prevent them
    from attacking others.
- a2: Incorrect. Engaging with the offender can make things worse and encourage them
    to continue their negative behavior.
- a3: Correct! Reporting the behavior to the social media platform is essential as
    it can lead to the removal of the offending material and even account suspension
    in the worst case.
- a4: Incorrect. Ignoring the behavior can make it easier for the offender to target
    others, and it doesn't prevent them from doing it again in the future.
